  <br>
   <p>People say love lasts for eternity but it was different for me....<br>
The time I thought the flower of youth bloomed for me it got crushed....<br>
The time I thought I got life,  I got murdered......<br>
This is my story, an uncompleted story of my romance which left me dead for eternity....<br>
<br>  
        It all started during the 3rd term exams, I was paired with class 9 and class 6 on my side and infront of me was a girl, I wasn't I Interested in her at first but time made us come close, the first day of exam we exchanged names with her, her name was SRIYASHI, I made her laugh by making funny jokes and helped her as much as I Could during the exams, I wasn't so talented so I would ask others for the answer of her questions. I got to the point when I left my paper for the completion of hers. I thought why I was helping her so much. I couldn't get any answer.When I talked with her my heartbeats went faster and I got nervous. Then arrived the final day of the exam, I had a small crush on her, I wished her bye and told to see her again.  I went on with my daily life thinking I would forget her but she was stuck on my head, whenever I was free I just remembered about her. When school reopened my crush had turned into love. I was always thinking about her and one day I decided ti purpose to her. I asked my friend aadarsh with the purposing and he helped. We were exchanging letters at first and flirting a bit . I knew she had a crush on me so  I gathered all my courage and purposed to her. Ble was coming near but I didn't care about it. All it was on my mind was sriyashi. I purposed to her and she said " Your ble is near so for now lets stay as best friends but my ans to yr purposal is yes" those words are still carved Into my head. I was the happiest man on the planet during that time. We slowly started getting closer and we talked a lot In messanger. Ble ended and we were a happy couple. I had already planned to make her mine for ever but things took a wild turn which tore me apart and left me dead.<br>
<br>
     2079-02-20 the day of Sriyashis birthday, I wished her happy birthday at 12 am and prepare 15 kitkats for her 15th birthday. I was so excited to give it to her but who knew this would turn into something so bad. I waited for tiffin time eagerly. When the bell rang pramis for Sriyashis class came calling for me. I thought the class was hyping for my present but I was wrong. A 1000 times wrong. I went to talk to her, I was super happy but he ripped my happiness. She broke up our relation, when I heard that I fell to an endless void. She liked another man and went out with him. She tore me apart. I acted like I was laughing and nothing happened but I was crying from inside. The pain I felt I my heart was much more painful then any other pain in my heart.<br>
<br>
          When I thought the spring of my youth bloomed it got crushed. They say love never loosed but for me my love lost. I loved her with all my heart but i think I wasn't good enough for  her.
<br> 
    " Love never looses , if it does then it isn't true love ". This statement was false for me......

<h3>CHAPTER 2 </h3>
<br>
<p>Newton's 3rd law ; every action has an equal or opposite reaction. This thing was applied in my love life as well....<br>
People say that karma is real and I saw that with my own eyes......<br>
     After the breakup I was broken from deep inside, I gave up hope in my life, all of my motivation was crushed to pieces, all there was left was a broken heart of a teenage boy who had experienced true love. Even though shriyahi had no feelings for me I had it for her. People say that true love lasts for eternity and it true for me. Even she did such a bad thing for me, I still loved her. I wanted to hate her, I wanted to erase her from my life but I could never do that. I loved her from all my heart. <br>
     After breakup people usually block the other person and never reach out to them. But I could never do that, although we weren't in any relation, I still chatted with her, I couldn't live without her. She was kind enough to still chat with me. Although she had a new boyfriend and i was her ex, she still  saw me as a friend. I used to talk to her in tiktok telling her how sad I was and she used to take me as a joke. She used to reply as if I had no feelings. I still cared for her and worried for her and I even supported her relation even though I hated it from inside. She turned very cold towards me but also I never stopped loving her. There was such a awkward relationship between her as I used to brag to her about my depression and she could only replay as " yes" or "ehh" or "lol".<br>
       Just like a ball thrown up always comes down, the relation she made with Prince came down. Karma hit her hard. She made a excuse with me during breakup that her parents knew about our relation. This time Prince's sister knew about their relation. Prince's sister seized Prince's I'd and started blackmailing Shriyashi and Prince. Their relation stood on a thin rope almost about to tear. If I were others they would be happy about them as they got karma but u wasn't like others. I felt bad for her in someway but also felt good for Prince that his sister knew about their relation. Now, Shriyashi is in the most awkward situation of her life having nowhere to go.....<br>
     She tells me about her issues and I listen to them trying to make her at ease. If I were other I would laugh at her and leave her but I wasn't others, I tried to make her ease and make her happy. My heart still can't decide why I am still talking to her when she ended our relationship. I never thought love could be this painful. With every message of her I feel a pain in my heart but i still don't stop......<br>
      I wonder sometimes, if she re-purposed to me someday what would be my answer?...</p>
